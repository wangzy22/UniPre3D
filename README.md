UniPre3D is the first unified pre-training method for 3D point clouds that effectively handles both object- and scene-level data through cross-modal Gaussian splatting.

<div align=center>
<img src='assets\pipeline.png' width=450 height=260>
</div>

Our proposed pre-training task involves predicting Gaussian parameters from the input point cloud. The 3D backbone network is expected to extract representative features, and 3D Gaussian splatting is implemented to render images for direct supervision. To incorporate additional texture information and adjust task complexity, we introduce a pre-trained image model and propose a scale-adaptive fusion block to accommodate varying data scales.

## Visualization Results üì∑

Below is visualization of UniPre3D pre-training outputs. The first row presents the input point clouds, followed by the reference view images in the second row. The third row displays the rendered images, which are supervised by the ground truth images shown in the fourth row. In the rightmost column, we illustrate a schematic diagram of the view selection principle for both object- and scene-level samples.

## Object-level Pre-training ü™ë <a id="object-pretraining"></a>

Object-level pre-training is a technique where we train a 3D model on a large collection of individual 3D objects before fine-tuning it for specific downstream tasks. This approach helps the model learn fundamental geometric patterns and structural representations that can be transferred to various 3D understanding tasks.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Focuses on learning from individual objects (e.g., chairs, airplanes, cars)
- Captures fine-grained local geometric structures
- Enables knowledge transfer to tasks like object classification and part segmentation

> We cache dataset images in memory to accelerate data loading.  If you encounter memory constraints: Disable this feature by setting `opt.record_img` to `false` in `configs/settings.yaml`

## Finetune on Object-level Downstream Tasks üéØ <a id="finetune-object"></a>

We evaluate the effectiveness of UniPre3D on various object-level downstream tasks, including:
- Object Classification
- Part Segmentation
- Object Detection

## Scene-level Pretraining üè† <a id="scene-level-pretraining-setup"></a>

Scene-level pretraining focuses on learning representations from complex 3D environments containing multiple objects and spatial relationships. This approach helps models understand large-scale geometric structures and spatial contexts that are crucial for scene understanding tasks.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Processes complete indoor/outdoor scenes rather than individual objects
- Captures long-range spatial relationships and contextual information
- Optimized for tasks like semantic segmentation and instance segmentation
